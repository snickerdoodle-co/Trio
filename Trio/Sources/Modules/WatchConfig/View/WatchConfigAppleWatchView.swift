Only if nobody used the pod across three looks, about 10 minutes, does the watch start untethered mode by itself from the iPhone's copy, as Start Without Phone does, about 15 minutes after the iPhone's last reading; right before its first dose it checks once more that the iPhone hasn't used the pod since. If a look shows the iPhone used the pod, the watch doesn't look again for about 10 minutes unless it hears from the iPhone, because the iPhone pauses its dosing briefly after each look. When the iPhone is back in reach for a minute, the watch hands the pump back by itself, and it lets go at once if the pod shows the iPhone has used it. Idea and design by Elias Maurer."
